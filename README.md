Install
===

This is specific to my environment, written specifically to restore my
environment.

Read ORDER file and cleanup special case and make it single command install

Checkout this package and run install.sh. Since the restore will be rarely
executed I would need some tweaks after this to get my dev environment
restored to the way it was in my DevDesktop earlier.

TODOs
===
    [1] Workspace setup and restore
    [2] Java specific
    [3] Python/Ruby specific
